![Dataflow in CCloud](https://docs.confluent.io/current/_images/ccloud-data-flow-inspect-producers.png)

This demo expects some preparation work, before you can execute the scripts. If all the preparation is done, then everything starts automatically:
* Confluent Platform 5.4 is installed locally
* confluent cloud cli is installed locally

* A Confluent Cloud Account have to be created
* An environment in Confluent Cloud have to be created and named in the script `env-vars`

* Your Confluent Cloud Password: XX_CCLOUD_PASSWORD=ZZZZZZZZZ
* The name for the Confluent Cluster: XX_CCLOUD_CLUSTERNAME=DEMODATAFLOW
